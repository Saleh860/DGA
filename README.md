# DGA
Dissolved Gas Analysis GUI Tool

This software package is intended to provide researchers with an extensible framework to test new DGA methods and compare the accuracy of different methods on a variety of existing data sets as well as user-defined data sets 
Researchers can implement new methods and integrate them into the MATLAB basecode in a simple way. 
Integrating DGA methods implemented in other programming language is also supported.
